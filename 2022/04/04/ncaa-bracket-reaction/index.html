<p>My thinking going into the creation of my model for the NCAA Tournament included multiple factors that I believe make a good basketball team. I valued the importance of a complete team and I figured that would be the biggest indicator of teams who would be consistent and make a deep run in the tournament. Because of this, I decided to use adjusted offensive efficiency and adjusted defensive efficiency statistics from KenPom. I also used true shooting percentage, offensive rebound percentage, defensive rebound percentage and turnover percentage. I decided to leave out free throws because I figured that the amount of times a team made it to the free throw line would be inconsistent and high pressure situations where a players percentage would be affected by pressure and nerves. I was really trying to build my model off of the basics of being a complete basketball team.</p>
<p>With that being said, my results turned out to be pretty good compared to the rest as I finished in first place of our class competition even with Baylor as my predicted champion. In the West region I started off 50% in the round of 64. In the round of 32 I only had 2 winners correct with Gonzaga and Duke. From there I did not get any more games correct in the West region.</p>
<p>In the East region I got 5/8 games correct in the round of 64. In the round of 32 I only had 2 winners again in UCLA and Purdue. Once again from there on out I did not have another winner in the East region.</p>
<p>In the South region I got 6/8 games correct in the round of 64. In the round of 32 I had 3 games correct with Arizona, Houston and Villanova. In the Sweet 16 I got both of the games correct with Houston and Villanova. Then I predicted the Elite 8 winner in Villanova.</p>
<p>In the Midwest region I got 5/8 games correct in the round of 64. In the round of 32 I only had 1 winner with KU. Then in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 I predicted KU to win correctly.</p>
<p>I predicted 2 of the 4 Final Four teams with Kansas and Villanova who matched up against eachother. I predicted KU to win which they did, but unfortunately I had them matching up against Baylor in the Championship and losing.</p>
<p>My bracket went wrong in many ways and I am honestly completely shocked that I finished in first place. We can take a look at where my bracket went wrong with the other 2 final four teams that I selected in Baylor and Gonzaga.</p>
<p>Baylor took an early exit in the round of 32 against 8 seed North Carolina. In that game they lost 93-68. Now I am able to see that North Carolina made it all the way to the championship game. With this being said, I think we can say that Baylor had to face one of the hottest teams in all of college basketball which my model was unable to predict. In that game Baylor was outplayed in every statistical category except turnovers where they only committed 11 and UNC committed 21.</p>
<p>Gonzaga made it all the way to the Sweet 16 where they were defeated by 4 seed Arkansas 74-68. In this game Gonzaga very under performed compared to their first 2 games of the tournament where they scored 82 and 93 points. In the game against Arkansas they were statistically worse in every category except for rebounds where they grabbed 45 compared to Arkansas 42. I thin it is safe to say that only winning one statistical category by 3 rebounds is not going to win you many basketball games.</p>
<p>I think that our models are unable to predict the madness that March brings. There were many upsets and many teams who under performed when their seasons were on the line. The model would most likely be consistent in predicting winners over an entire season but when it comes down to a one game elimination tournament anything can happen. Because I ended up winning the class competition there is not much that I would do differently next time. I think some of it just comes down to luck in the end. something I would add to my model next time tho would definitely be to add how many times each team gets to the free throw line per game and their free throw percentages. I would also add in the KenPom luck factor, because in March a lot of luck and being hot at the right time can get you a long ways. Just look at Saint Peters for example. I donâ€™t think anyone saw that coming. But in the end, I am pretty happy with the results that I got and am going to enjoy my extra credit:).</p>
