<p>For my groups NBA betting model we took a number of factors into mind. We decided to factor in each teamâ€™s true shooting percentage, turnover percentage, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, three point percentage, offensive efficiency, and defensive efficiency. We figured that these metrics would give us the best shot at predicting the winners based on being a complete team. From there we decided to use cumulative means with all of those metrics and then used a support vector model to determine who was going to win.</p>
<p>After we got the results from our model we made our decisions based on a few factors. We did not just decide strictly on what the model predicted. We factored in how confident our model was in its decision. Some games the model would not be very confident in the result and we also factored in the money-line and risk vs reward opportunity. For most games where we chose favorites to win, we wanted to see our model have over a 50% confidence rating. When the model predicted less than 50% confidence for the favorite we decided to go with the underdog and also whatever our personal feelings were towards the game. We started more conservative in the beginning and got more aggressive with our bets towards the end because we had to dig ourselves out of a hole.</p>
<p>Our results were as followed. For the first game we took the Timberwolves $200 at +220 and won. For the second game we took the Suns $350 at -650 odds and won as well. For the third game we took the Nuggets $200 at +240 odds and lost. We then took the Suns $300 at -550 odds and lost again. After that we took the 76ers $200 at -130 odds and won. Next we took the Nuggets $200 at +110 odds and lost once again with the Nuggets. After we lost again with the Nuggets we missed a day of betting on the 22nd and lost money because of it. On the 23rd we took the Timberwolves $200 at +125 odds and won so we were 2-0 with the Wolves at this point. On the 24th we took the Suns $200 at -135 odds and lost. On the 25th we took the 76ers $200 at -350 odds and lost and also took the Mavericks $100 at -150 odds and won. Next we took the Warriors $200 at -440 odds and won. Next we took the Suns $500 at -135 odds and won. Then we went all in on our last bet and put $1000 on the Timberwolves at +100 odds and sadly lost it all. We finished with a 7-7 record down $719.82 and finished in last place.</p>
<p>What we learned during this process was that no model can accurately predict every game correctly. There is always going to be something that the model can not take into account and teams do not always play at the same level every game. The NBA playoffs are very competitive and intense and some of the series did not go the way people would have thought. What I learned about gambling and myself is that I should definitely stay away for a long time. If we were playing with real money, my group and I would be in some serious debt. Some debt that I do not have the money to pay for.</p>
