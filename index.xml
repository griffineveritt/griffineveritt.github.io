      <description>The Georgia Bulldogs have proven all season that they stand in a league of their own. They have blown out opponents week after week and are yet to be truly challenged heading into the SEC championship at 12-0 against the Alabama Crimson Tide.
We are going to take a look at some data from the 2021 season and find out if the Bulldogs are ever going to be challenged or if we should just hand them the National Title right now.</description>

      <description>Putting the steroids aside.. Barry Bonds had a pretty impressive MLB career. One that accounted for 7 MVP’s, 14 all-star games, 8 gold gloves and 12 silver sluggers.
It would probably be safe to say that any player with those kind of accolades, who didn’t take steroids, would be voted in to the hall of fame. But we are going to look at how dominant Bonds was and how he compares to current Hall of Fame inductees.</description>
